# to create a tuple use paranthesis () 
# tuples are immutable
# we can not edit tupple once you have created


# example 
t1 = (1,2,3,4,5,6)
print(t1)

t2 = ("String1",True,False,12,1)
print(t2)



# empty tuple
empty_tuple = ()
print(empty_tuple)


# to create a single element tuple make sure to write atleast one comma
single_element_tuple_wrong = (1)   # if you do this mean this will act like a value of variable not as tuple
print(single_element_tuple_wrong)


# do this to make a single element tuple
single_element_tuple_correct = ("string1",)
print(single_element_tuple_correct)



# ? TUPLE FUNCTIONS -------------------------------------------
 
#  all functions of list wordkd here expect function for mutating
